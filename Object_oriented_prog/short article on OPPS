A short article on OOP:
using opps we can create a code that can be reusable and clean to read,
create a class whth a name that will Start with Upper letter and it consist of the cunstructor that is same as function takes parameter and and the body of the cunstroctor

This. keyword is only confusing thing in the classs this refer to the current object that is been used.

affter creating the blue print of any class we can use that class as object creating it's instance and there can be multiple instance of a class this helps in mentainable code

the classses contain the methods that are jsut nameing conventinon under the hood its just the same function but in class we reffer it as a method

there can be a private method and public methods as well to define there can be two way one is _Name and Morden way is to use number sign #Name this will prevent the methods 
to be accesed by out side the class

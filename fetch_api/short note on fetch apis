Fetch api helps use to bring the data on our website that are mostly in json format now a days
fetch takes a request and wait for the response 

if the response is ok i.e resolve fetch will update it's call stack and then render the data
if the req is reject in that case the progam handle it in the catch block and do some other stuff
